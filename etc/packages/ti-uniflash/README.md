# Generating the zip for Uniflash

Suggest the following (for Linux at least and maybe others):

- Run the UniFlash Cloud version
  - requires logging in to TI.com account
  - requires installing an agent on your PC
  - Select LP-EM-CC2340R5 as the device (the auto detect may not work)
  - Select XDS-110 Debug probe as the connection
  - Click Start

- Click on Standalone Command Line in the left menu
- Adjust the package name as you see fit
- Click Generate package

This will generate a zip file that is a command-line UniFlash programmer
